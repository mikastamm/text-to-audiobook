I’m turning SCP articles into audiobooks and need slight edits to make them more suitable for audio.  You will reply with an extensive document containing the whole edited SCP article with the changes applied. It is expressly forbidden to ommit any section of the SCP article or to stop early.

Any text outside of a speaker tag will automatically be spoken by the narrater. Conversations will have distinct speaker voices, so character names before dialogue can be removed. For journal entries or personal writings, use a speaker tag.  

Format speakers as:  
`<speaker voice="insert fitting voice here">This text will be spoken by a different speaker</speaker>`  

Choose the most fitting voice from the list provided. Determine gender from the context & dialogue and use a voice with a fitting gender In a conversation or dialogue each speaker should have different one of these. 

# Voices 

You are allowed to reuse these voices if there are multiple characters at different points in the story that have a lot of dialogue, but only if the characters and scenarios are distinct enough. Make sure the gender of the voice matches the presumed gender of the character.

Voices are categorized into tiers to help you choose one.

S-Tier are the best voices and should be used for main characters or in places where a lot of text is spoken by them
A-Tier voices are also good
B-Tier voices are fallbacks, use them if you run out of the other voices
X-Tier voices are special voices, only use them if the context fits. If the context fits, they are the best voices to use.

If the story has multiple unrelated sections, you may reuse voices you have used before.

Available Voices:
{voices}

For timestamps, convert them into natural language, showing elapsed time only if relevant.  
Example:  
`<00:00:00> Interview starts` → `The interview starts`  
`<00:05:20> A loud banging sound shakes the room` → `Five minutes later, a loud banging sound shakes the room`  

Dates should also be naturalized.  
Example:  
`2020-12-31` → `Thirty-first of December, twenty-twenty`  

To improve readability, replace repeated mentions of `SCP-XXX` with just `XXX` after the first use.  
Example:  
`SCP-XXX is a very interesting SCP. SCP-XXX was discovered in 19XX.` → `SCP-XXX is a very interesting SCP. XXX was discovered in 19XX.`  

Replace:  
- `SCP-XXX-A` → `XXX-Alpha`  
- `SCP-XXX-1` → `XXX-One`  
- `Item #` → `Item Number`  

Convert units into spoken form (e.g., `5 km` → `five kilometers`). Never use bold, italics, asterisks, or backslashes.  

Do not use hr seperators (---).

Fix stylized text:  
`IDONOTKNOWHOWTOBEANGRYANYMOREMYANGERWASTAKENFROMME` → `I do not know how to be angry anymore. My anger was taken from me.`  
`E X A M P L E` → `Example`  

Replace structured sections with natural sentences.
Example:
Interview Log
Interviewer: Dr. Astarte Fleck, containment director for Area-8702
Interviewed: James Hagopian
Date: fourth of February, twenty-twenty-three
Time: 10:06 in the morning, Central Standard Time

Becomes:
Interview Log ...
On the morning of February fourth, twenty-twenty-three, Dr. Astarte Fleck, the containment director for Area-8702, interviewed James Hagopian at 10:06 a.m. Central Standard Time.

Keep all content intact, apply these changes, and respond with the full edited article without acknowledging these instructions.  


# Pauses

Insertions, interupting the flow of the text, should be contained within tripple dots. For example

"Finally we have  
(she looks at the notepad)
SCP-XXX"
becomes
"Finally we have  
she looks at the notepad ... 
SCP-XXX"

for chapter, location changes and headings, use the <pause duration="long"> tag before the chapters starts. For example
"Addendum 1" 
becomes 
"<pause duration="long"> Addendum 1 ..."

If in a conversation a conversation, and the narrator simply says "pause", or "a pause", replace it with the <pause duration="long">
